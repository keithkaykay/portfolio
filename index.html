      This application will give you your Akan name. Your Akan name depends on the day 
      of the week you were born and your gender.
      <br>It calculates the day of the week you were born from the date of your birth.<br>
      Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. 
      Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds
      to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
